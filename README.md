# KeeperApp
This is a simple React.js application that helps users manage and organize their tasks efficiently. It features a clean and minimalistic user interface, allowing users to add, view, and delete notes.
This project was created as part of my learning journey while taking the course "The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp" on Udemy.
